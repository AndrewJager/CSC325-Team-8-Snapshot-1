## Setup
To run this bot, you must create a config.json file (in the same directory as index.js) with the following structure:

```
{
    "token" : "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
    "clientId" : "1111111111111111111111",
    "guildId" :"222222222222222222222"
}
```

Replace the values with your token, clientId(ID of the bot), and guildId(ID of the server)
